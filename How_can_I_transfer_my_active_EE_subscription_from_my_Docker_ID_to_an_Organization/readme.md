It is recommended that customers associate their Docker Enterprise Edition Subscription to an organization. Doing so allows any member of the "owners" team of an organization access to this subscription. The following Knowledge Base articles explains how to convert a user account to an organization:

[How do I convert my Docker Hub/Cloud user account into an organization account?](https://success.docker.com/Cloud/Solve/How_do_I_convert_my_Docker_Hub%2F%2FCloud_user_account_into_an_organization_account%3F "https://success.docker.com/Cloud/Solve/How_do_I_convert_my_Docker_Hub%2F%2FCloud_user_account_into_an_organization_account%3F")

Transfer of the EE subscription can be accomplished by having the the current owner of the subscription open a support case requesting the subscription to be transferred. There are a few steps that need to be taken to in order for the transfer to happen.

* The user requesting the transfer must be the current owner of the subscription
* If the user wants to continue to have access to the subscription they must also be a member of the "owners" team of the organization they are requesting to transfer the subscription to.
* The current owner of the subscription will need to open a support case with [Docker Support](https://support.docker.com "https://support.docker.com") requesting the transfer.
