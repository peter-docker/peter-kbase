## Introduction

This document is your guide to the Docker Support Site at [support.docker.com](https://support.docker.com/ "https://support.docker.com/"). It steps you through using the site, including managing technical support cases.

## Logging in to Docker Support

The [Docker Support Site](https://support.docker.com "https://support.docker.com"), [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/ "https://hub.docker.com/"), [Docker Cloud](https://cloud.docker.com/ "https://cloud.docker.com/"), and [Docker Store](https://success.docker.com/Support/Docker_Support_Site_User_Guide "Docker Support Site User Guide") all use a common Docker ID for the username and password. You must be logged in to the [Docker Support Site](https://support.docker.com/ "https://support.docker.com/") with your Docker ID to view, create, or modify cases. To start, go to [support.docker.com](https://support.docker.com/ "https://support.docker.com/"). If you are not already logged in with your Docker ID, you will be redirected to the Docker Hub login page.

> If you don't have a login, you will need to [create a Docker ID](https://hub.docker.com/ "https://hub.docker.com/"). Follow the instructions from [docs.docker.com](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/accounts/#/register-for-a-docker-id "https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/accounts/#/register-for-a-docker-id") to do so.

The first time you successfully log into the Docker Support Site, you may be prompted to allow the Docker Support Site to access the profile information from your Docker ID. Click **Authorize** to continue.

If there are any issues authenticating you to the Docker Support Site you will automatically be redirected to the [Account Support Form](https://success.docker.com/Support "Account Support Form") which can be used to request access and ensure your Docker ID is associated with the appropriate support entitled account. Include your name, email address, and the account which has technical support entitlements.

## Viewing Cases and Entitlements

After successful login, you will see all open cases you've created so far (if any). If you don't see any cases and you know you've created them, or you just want to refresh the list, you can hit the "recycle/refresh" button (next to the "New Case" button) to refresh the case list.

![](./images/all_open_cases.png)

There are two views available from this page: **Cases** and **Entitlements**.

By default, you will see the **Cases** view. From the pull-down menu above the list of cases, you have the following sort options:

* **All Cases** — All cases for you or your organization (if this latter feature has been enabled for your team). This includes closed cases.
* **All Open Cases** — All open cases for your or your organization
* **My Cases** — All cases owned by you
* **Recently Viewed Cases** — Cased you have recently viewed

Click the **Entitlements** tab at the top of the page to view a list of active support entitlements for your organization.

![](./images/entitlements.png)

Click on the **Entitlement Name** to view details for the entitlement, including cases associated with the entitlement.

> Some entitlement names include a node count such as **Docker Datacenter with Business Critical Support - 1 Node (1 year subscription)**. These entitlement names indicate how many nodes are supported with each entitlement — they do not represent the number of those entitlements associated with your account. The **Entitlements** tab lists each type of entitlement associated with your account, but not the number of each type of entitlement.

## Opening a Support Case

You must be logged in to open a support ticket. On the **Cases** tab, click the** New Case** button. The following will appear:

![](./images/new_case.png)

By default, you are set as the **Contact Name**.

For the **Entitlement Name**, click the search button next to the entry field and select one of your available support entitlements. Only active entitlements are shown.

Provide the following for each new case:

###### **Priority**

[Commercial Support Service ](https://success.docker.com/Policies/Commercial_Support_Service_Levels "https://success.docker.com/Policies/Commercial_Support_Service_Levels")[Levels](https://success.docker.com/Policies/Commercial_Support_Service_Levels "https://success.docker.com/Policies/Commercial_Support_Service_Levels")

###### Product

Select the Docker product for the case. If it concerns more than one product, select the primary product affected.

###### Subject and Description

Lastly, include a subject and description. The subject should summarize the case, and the description should give details.

> As you type the subject, similar issues that have already been solved and documented in the [Docker Knowledgebase](https://success.docker.com/ "Knowledge Base") are shown. These recommendations may offer a quick resolution to your issue. If you see a KBase recommendation that applies to your issue, click on it to review the article.

What to include when opening a support ticket
###### Attachment (Optional)

When creating a ticket, you can attachment a file to it when submitting it. To do so, click **Submit & Add Attachment**. You will be prompted to select a file to upload. You will be able to add attachments later as well.

> After providing the information needed for a new case, be sure to **Submit** the case so that it is assigned a case number and Docker Technical Support staff are notified.

## Responding to Open Cases

Each time Docker Support responds to your case, or anything related to your case changes, you will receive an email. To respond to Docker Support about your case, either

* Reply to the email from your email client. The body of your reply will be added as a case comment. Any files attached to the email will be attached to the case.

or

* Click on the link in the email and respond by adding a case comment. If you need to attach a file, click on the **Attach File** button.

## Viewing and Updating an Existing Case

After logging into the Docker Support site, you will see a list of your open cases. If you don't see the case you are looking for, use the **View** pull-down menu to change the list to **All Cases**, **All Open Cases**, **My Cases, **or **Recently Viewed Cases**. Click on the **Case Number** or the **Subject** of the case you want to modify. You will then see the case details:

![](./images/case_details.png)

* Add a Comment
* Attach a File
* View the Case History

> The case status can't be changed from this page. To close a case, click the **Close Case** button. To re-open a case, add a comment or attach a file to it — the status will automatically change back to **Open**.

## Closing a Case

To close a case from the **Case Detail** page, click the **Close Case** button at the top of page. On the next page, use the pull-down menu to change the status of the case to **Resolved**. Click **Submit** to finish the process.

## Re-Opening a Case

If you need to re-opening a resolved case, add a new comment to the case to change the status from **Resolved** to **Open**.
