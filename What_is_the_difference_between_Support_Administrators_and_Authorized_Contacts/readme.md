When your company purchases a commercial subscription of Docker EE, there are two main contacts that interact with Docker Support: a **Support Administrator** and an **Authorized Contact**.

A **Support Administrator** is a person at your company that is designated as the primary owner of the support relationship with Docker. A Support Administrator has permissions to add, remove, or modify an Authorized Contact. They will receive relevant product and service notifications from Docker.

An **Authorized Contact** is a person that directly interfaces with Docker Support to ask questions or report issues by submitting a support request. Depending on your level of support, your company may designate up to four ([Business Day](https://success.docker.com/Policies/Commercial_Support_Service_Levels "Commercial Support Service Levels")) or eight ([Business Critical](https://success.docker.com/Policies/Commercial_Support_Service_Levels "Commercial Support Service Levels")) Authorized Contacts per account. To submit a support request, see *[How to contact Docker Support](https://success.docker.com/Support "Account Support Form")*.

To add or remove an Authorized Contact, see *[How to add or remove an Authorized Contact](/article/How_do_I_add_or_remove_an_Authorized_Contact%3F "How do I add or remove an Authorized Contact?")*.
