title: "Why do I have stopped docker/ucp-agent containers named ucp-reconcile on my UCP nodes?"
summary: "There are stopped docker/ucp-agent containers named ucp-reconcile on my UCP nodes. What should I do about them? Leave them be. They are supposed to be there. UCP nodes have a stopped docker/ucp-agent container named ucp-reconcile that has the ability to execute /bin/ucp-agent recon. These containers are autogenerated by UCP and stay in a stopped state unless UCP needs to reconcile the state of the node within the cluster."

There are stopped docker/ucp-agent containers named `ucp-reconcile` on my UCP nodes. What should I do about them?

Leave them be. They are supposed to be there. UCP nodes have a stopped docker/ucp-agent container named `ucp-reconcile` that has the ability to execute `/bin/ucp-agent recon`. These containers are autogenerated by UCP and stay in a stopped state unless UCP needs to reconcile the state of the node within the cluster.
