## Issue

Docker Technical Support has asked me to create and upload a "Support Dump." What is that, and how do I create one?

## Prerequisites

Before performing these steps, you must meet the following requirements:

* Docker Enterprise Edition - Standard or Advanced
* Also known as EE Standard or EE Advanced

## Steps

Follow the instructions in the Docker documentation for your UCP version:

- 2.1 Series: https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.1/guides/get-support/
- 2.2 Series: https://docs.docker.com/datacenter/ucp/2.2/guides/get-support/
