## Question

I recently created a new account in Docker Hub. When I try to click the verification link in the account activation email sent by Docker, it did not work, and threw a "502 Bad Gateway" error instead. What do I do now?

Answer

It is likely that the confirmation link has expired. Docker Hub account confirmation links normally expire within 24 hours of sign-up. Using the email address that you entered to sign-up you can re-trigger a the confirmation email through Docker Hub's password reset page: 

<https://hub.docker.com/reset-password/>
.

If you are still unable to verify your account and login to Docker Hub, please [open a Customer Service Request](https://success.docker.com/Support "Customer Service") providing additional details about the issue you're experiencing.
