## Question

* Why does my credit card get rejected on Docker Hub?
* Why am I getting emails notifying me of failed transactions when my credit card worked fine previously?

## Answer

You can check on the reason for the failed transaction by [opening a support case](https://support.docker.com/ "https://support.docker.com/"). The most common reason for failed transactions is due to the credit card company rejecting the transaction. If this is the case, call your credit card company and ask them to approve the transaction. Alternatively, you can switch to another card by updating your billing information.
