No, a free Docker Hub organization account does not come with any private repositories. Only a Docker Hub __user account__ includes one free private repository.

If you wish to utilize private repositories with your organization account, upgrade your organization account's subscription to a paid Docker Hub plan by clicking on **Organizations** in the top navigation bar and then clicking on **Billing**.

For more information on private repositories, please refer to <https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/repos/#private-repositories>.
