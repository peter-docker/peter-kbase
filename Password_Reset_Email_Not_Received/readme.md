# Question

I tried to reset my password and I didn't receive an email, what should I do?

# Answer

Please note, organization accounts do not have email addresses associated with them. Organization accounts can be managed by any users in the 'Owners' team.

If you are trying to reset a user account password and are still not receiving a 'Password Reset' email, [open a support case](https://support.docker.com/ "https://support.docker.com/") and include:

* Your Docker Cloud username
* Your registered email address
