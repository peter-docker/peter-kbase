If payment fails, the card will automatically be run every two days.

If your Docker Cloud payment fails it usually means:
- The card has expired.
- The card has been declined by the bank. 

If your credit card has expired, you can update your billing details using this [link](https://success.docker.com/article/Where_can_I_change_my_billing_details). The card will be automatically run two days after the failed payment date.
If the payment was blocked by the bank, you will need to contact them for more information, no other information is provided to Docker.
