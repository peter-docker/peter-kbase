## Question

How do I delete a Docker Hub or Docker Cloud account?

## Answer

Deleting your Docker Hub/Cloud account will permanently remove your account and cannot be recovered. **Your Docker Hub/Cloud account may also be linked to other Docker products and services, so deleting your account will also disable access to those products and services.**

Before submitting a request to delete your account, please complete the following:

* Delete all public and private repositories for this account.
* If you have a subscription plan, cancel any active subscriptions on Docker Hub and Docker Cloud and confirm that your account has been downgraded to the **free **plan.
* If you belong to an organization, remove your account from all organizations. If you are the sole owner of any organization, either add someone to the "**owners**" team and then remove yourself from the organization **or** submit a request to delete the organization as well.
* If you have a license key you wish to keep, [download the key](/article/How_do_I_download_my_Docker_license_key%3F "How to download your Docker license key") from your Docker Hub account. The download link will no longer be available after the account deletion.
* Unlink your GitHub and Bitbucket source providers on Docker Hub [here](https://hub.docker.com/account/authorized-services/ "https://hub.docker.com/account/authorized-services/") and Docker Cloud [here](https://cloud.docker.com/app/_/settings "https://cloud.docker.com/app/_/settings").
* Unlink all public cloud providers on Docker Cloud.
* Delete all nodes, services, and stacks on Docker Cloud.

Once you've completed the steps above, please open a [Customer Service Request](https://success.docker.com/Support) using the email address associated with the account and provide the Docker ID of the account you wish to delete.
