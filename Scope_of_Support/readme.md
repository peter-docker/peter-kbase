## Docker Enterprise Edition

[Docker Enterprise Edition](https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition "https://www.docker.com/enterprise-edition") is a subscription of software, support, and certification for enterprise dev and IT teams building and managing critical apps in production at scale. Docker EE provides a modern and trusted platform for all apps with integrated management and security across the app lifecycle, and includes three main technology components: the Docker daemon (fka "Engine"), Docker Trusted Registry (DTR), and Docker Universal Control Plane (UCP). Docker EE is validated and supported to work in specific operating environments as outlined in the [Docker Compatibility Matrix](/Policies/Compatibility_Matrix "Compatibility Matrix"), adhere to the [Docker Maintenance Lifecycle](/Policies/Maintenance_Lifecycle "Maintenance Lifecycle v2"), and is supported within the defined **Docker Scope of Support** and [Docker Commercial Support Service Levels](/Policies/Commercial_Support_Service_Levels "Commercial Support Service Levels").
