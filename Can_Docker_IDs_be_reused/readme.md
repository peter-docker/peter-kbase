TESTING TESTING TESTING AND MORE TESTING!!!

Once a Docker ID has been created, it can not be used to create a new account, even if the account has been deactivated.

If you need to change your email address and you have access to your account, you can change your email address in the account settings.

If you mistyped your email address or used the wrong email during Docker Hub or Docker Cloud registration, and you can not access your account, open a [Customer Service Request](https://success.docker.com/Support "Account Support Form") and include your username and the mistyped email address.
