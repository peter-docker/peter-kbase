### Errors

Docker is aware and actively working on an issue that occasionally prevents users from cancelling/downgrading subscription plans.

As a workaround, Docker Support can cancel the subscription on your behalf. In order to help streamline this process, we ask users to [open a support case](https://support.docker.com/ "https://support.docker.com/") providing/confirming the following information:

* Name of the user account or organization with the subscription plan
* Be sure to open the ticket from an authorized billing contact 
    * Email address on the support ticket has to correspond with the user account
    * User account needs to be an owner account of organization (if requesting cancelling/downgrade of subscription on an organization)
    * Email address on support ticket is also listed within the billing information
* If downgrading subscription plans, please let us know which plan you would like to downgrade to

After receiving this information Docker Support will be able to process your request in a timely manner.

> **Note**: *Upon cancelling a subscription plan, any private repositories will become locked, disabling pushing or pulling.*
