Where can I find statically linked versions of the packages and executables for Docker CE? I need the static versions instead of the 
more commonly available dynamically linked versions.


As of this writing, you can find the statically linked packages and executables for several Linux variants
at [this location](https://download.docker.com/linux/static/)

This base location for these packages is subject to change.
