Private repositories allow you to have repositories that contain images that you want to keep private, either to your own account or within an organization or team. 
One free private repository is provided to each free user account, but this free private repository can not be used by an of your organizations.

A free Docker Hub organization account does not come with any private repositories.

If you wish to utilize private repositories with your organization account, upgrade your organization account's subscriptionto a paid Docker Hub plan by clicking on **Organizations** in the top navigation bar and then clicking on **Billing**.
