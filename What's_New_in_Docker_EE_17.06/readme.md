## Downgrading your Docker EE license

As of Docker EE 17.06, several features are enabled by having an advanced-tier license. However, you will not be able to downgrade your license from advanced to standard if you are actively using any of the advanced UCP features. To downgrade your license, you need to manually reconfigure UCP so that no advanced tier features are in use. To do that, use the instructions in the following article before applying your new license:
