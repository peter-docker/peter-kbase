For an existing DTR instance, it is possible to **reconfigure** DTR to use self-signed certificates generated by DTR.

This can be helpful in following example instances:

* If you used 3rd party certificates and want to revert back to the built-in DTR self-signed certificates.
* Can not access DTR UI due to expired certificates.

## Resolution

To revert to self-signed certificates for DTR:

1. Run the DTR reconfigure command and change to a different `dtr-external-url` (be sure to change to your local IP address): 
    
        docker run -it --rm docker/dtr reconfigure --dtr-external-url <^>10.0.0.5<^^> --ucp-insecure-tls --ucp-url https://<^>x.x.x.x:443<^^>
2. Look for following output to show that DTR generated new certificates: 
    
        INFO[0008] TLS certificate does not match domain name    domainName=<^>10.0.0.5<^^>
        INFO[0024] Generated TLS certificate.                    domain=<^>10.0.0.5<^^>
3. Wait a minute or 2 for the containers to be stable.
4. Proceed to log into the UI using the newly configured DTR external URL.
